Javascript:
    The port number is derived from a javascript function.
    The selenium webdriver is used to extract the javascript results


Data Items:
    Two data items that needed further processing were:
        lastUpdate
        countryCity

    lastUpdate defines the data/time when the ip:port was last verified.
    The Xpath selector separated the date and time by a newline.

    countryCity identifies the country and city where the ip:port is located.
    Separating the country from the city to insert in the database involved further processing.
    Also, a '!' (bang) is occasionally present along with countryCity.
    The reason, at this time, is unknown.  The bang is separated and identified for further processing.


Process:
    At spider start-up, the selenium webdriver is initiated (jsIp_spider.py).
    The parse manager parses the Front Page through its own fronPage() function.
    The parse manager extracts all the TLD to follow and parses each TLD (with pages).
    The page loader parses each proxy page and passes items to the pipeline.
    The pipeline inserts each item into its respective database table.
    At spider close, the selenium webdriver is closed.

Extras:
    twisted adbapi support
